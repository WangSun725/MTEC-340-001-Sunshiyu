<h3>My Favorite Game</h3>
<h5>Sunshiyu Wang</h5>
My favorite game is The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The game has developed by Nintendo and really focusing on details. It has a grand background story and if you do not like the main plot, you can just walk through the montain or explore new area with the horse, expect there are some surprise in each area. The game engine used for the game is a modified version of the Havok physics engine and the release date is March 3, 2017.

The similar game include: Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey; Horizon Zero Dawn; Red Dead Redemption 2.
